# Lecture 1 markdown

<!--
This is a small interactive book. There are three types of blocks here:

A display formula

$$x^2 + y^2 = z^2$$

A note

:::{note}
Here is a note!
:::

:::{important}
This is hella important!
:::

:::{warning}
This is hella important!
:::

:::{seealso}

Content

And a code block

```
import plotly.io as pio
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.offline as py

df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species", size="sepal_length")
fig
```

And here is a dropdown

```{dropdown} Here's my dropdown
And here's my dropdown content
```

```{tabbed} Tab 1 title
My first tab
```
```{tabbed} Tab 2 title
My second tab with `some code`!
```
```{tabbed} Tab 3 title
My second tab with `some code`!
```

Finally ams-style formulas

\begin{gather*}
a_1=b_1+c_1\\
a_2=b_2+c_2-d_2+e_2
\end{gather*}

\begin{align}
a_{11}& =b_{11}&
  a_{12}& =b_{12}\\
a_{21}& =b_{21}&
  a_{22}& =b_{22}+c_{22}
\end{align} -->
